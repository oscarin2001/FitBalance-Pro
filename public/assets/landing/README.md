# Landing assets

Use these folders to keep each section organized:

- `hero/` → background gradients, people photos or logos that appear above the fold.
- `mockups/` → exported dashboard/mobile mockups referenced in the "Producto" block.
- `sections/highlights/` → icons for the three feature cards.
- `sections/how-it-works/` → any illustrations for the process steps.
- `sections/cta/` → badges, partner logos or screenshots placed near the final CTA.

Add files and reference them with paths like `/assets/landing/hero/hero-bg.png`.
